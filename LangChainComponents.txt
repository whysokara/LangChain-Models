Introduction to Langchain ====
LC is an open-source framework for developing applications powered by LLMs

Langchain Components (6)==
- Models 
- Prompts
- Chain
- Memory
- Index
- Agents


= Models
Core interface through which you interact with AI models
Type of Model:
-Language (LLMs) text in - text out
-Embedding text in - vector out (Semantic Search)

= Prompts
inputs provided to LLM
Types of Prompt:
-Dynamic and reusable Prompt .. {}
-Role Based .. System User
-Few Shot .. Examples

= Chains
we can build pipelines

= Indexes
connect your application to external knowledge base such as pdf, databases, wesites etc

Indexes consists of four things
-Doc loader
-text splitter
-Vector store
-retrivers

= Memory
LLM apis are stateless

Types of Memory
-ConversationBufferMemory
-ConversationBufferWindowMemory(last n)
-Summarizer-BasedMemory
-Custom Memory

= Agents
has reasoning capabilities and access to tools
